      <h3>Food &amp; Drinks</h3>
      <p>Tap water in Slovenia is drinkable, and actually pretty good. The hotel even holds a certificate for it. We ask you to bring your own water bottles and refil them with tap water from the restrooms.</p>
      <p>Other drinks are available at the bar, which is open:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Friday 08:00 - 23:00</li>
        <li>Saturday &amp; Sunday 11:00 - 23:00</li>
      </ul>
      <p>They prepared some promotional prices for dancers:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>water 0,75l bottle 4 eur,</li>
        <li>cuba libre 10 eur,</li>
        <li>gin tonic 10 eur.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You may bring your own food and drinks to the venue, but please do NOT place them inside the ballrooms. <span class="bold">Any open drinks will be removed and thrown away</span>, especially if found near DJ booth or other electronic equipment.</p>
      <p>Food is available in the hotel lounge, but their restaurant is a bit slow, and cannot process such large amount of people eating at the same time. Please consider ordering via Wolt or Glovo, or visiting one of the restaurants/bars nearby. Note that most restaurants in the area are closed on Sundays, so make sure to check beforehand.
