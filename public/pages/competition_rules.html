        <h1>Competition Rules</h1>
        <p>This event offers only competitions in Jack & Jill format. All competitions will be ran in accordance with the <a href="https://www.worldsdc.com/wsdc-points-registry-rules/">official WSDC rules</a>.</p>
        <div>
            <h3>Jack & Jill format</h3>
            <p>Jack & Jill competitions are designed to highlight skills in spontaneous West Coast Swing dancing with a variety of partners and music. A bit of “luck of the draw” comes into play as well. Competitors enter as individuals, are randomly assigned partners, and dance to music selected by our competition DJ.</p>
            <p>During the preliminary and semifinal rounds, you will dance in heats with several partners selected randomly. Although you will be judged individually on a callback basis, you must demonstrate good teamwork with all your partners to advance to the next round.</p>
            <p>If there is an imbalance in the number of leaders and followers, some contestants will dance twice. However, even if your name is not called, you should remain in the ballroom throughout the competition, in case any additional competitors are needed at the last minute to dance again.</p>
            <p>Our chief judge will determine the exact number of finalists after our scorer has tallied the results of the callbacks.</p>
            <p>In the finals, we will use a random drawing (or some other random method) to determine your partner. No redraws will be permitted for any reason – it’s luck of the draw. Finalists will be judged as couples.</p>
            <p>Additional all-skate dances in finals can be requested by the judges.</p>

            <h3>Eligibility requirements</h3>
            <p>To compete at the event, you must:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>be a holder of any pass which is eligible to participate in competitions,</li>
                <li>register for each competition by the official entry deadline (see the weekend schedule),</li>
                <li>pick up your bib number during competition registration times and wear it in all competitions except spotlight format,</li>
                <li>pay any required entry fees,</li>
                <li>meet all other specific entry requirements outlined in these rules.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Division entry requirements</h3>
            <p>Multiple registrations are allowed. You may choose to enter any competitions for which you meet the specific entry requirements. For WSDC Jack & Jill competitions, it is possible to compete in 2 skill level division under some circumstances and additionally in any open/age-based divisions.</p>
            <p>You are allowed to enter any competition in any role. You can dance different competitions in different roles. You may sign up for at most 1 skill-level division per role and additionally any age-based divisions that you qualify for. You may not dance same competition and same division in both roles. You can only dance in Newcomers if you don’t have any WSDC Newcomer points in that specific role.</p>
            <p>We will verify that you are eligible for the competitions you enter by checking the World Swing Dance Council (WSDC) Points Registry and other sources of information, if applicable. In some cases (for example, if you submit a petition or do not have the required WSDC points), we may reassign you to a different division. If you have concerns that other contestants are entered in an incorrect division or are ineligible, please inform our chief judge privately as soon as possible. We will investigate and take appropriate action, if necessary.</p>
            <p>If we determine before or during a competition that you have registered for the wrong division or are not eligible, we will reassign you to the correct division (if possible) or allow you to withdraw. If we discover your error after the finals, we may drop you (and your partner) out of awards. If we made the error and assigned you incorrectly, no penalty will be applied.</p>

            <h3>Submitting a petition</h3>
            <p>If you want to enter a competition for which you do not meet the entry requirements, or want to change divisions, you should submit a petition. When you register, request a petition form. Fill out the form and submit it before the registration deadline. Include contact information (such as your cell phone number or hotel room number) so staff may reach you during the event.</p>
            <p>The chief judge will review your petition and approve or deny your request. Our competition staff will notify you as soon as possible of the decision. If you are requesting to change divisions, you should be prepared to compete in the original division if your petition is denied.</p>
            <p>If you qualify for a higher division, but the points are not listed in the registry database yet, please fill out a petition and include the event, placement and tier of the competition as well as a contact for the event so we are able to verify.</p>

            <h3>Your responsibilities as a competitor</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Planning ahead</strong><br>You may register for competitions in advance or at the event (during times listed on the schedule). If you register in advance, you should plan to pick up your bib number at the event. Be sure to check for any last-minute changes to the schedule.</li>
                <li><strong>Knowing the rules</strong><br>You should read the rules carefully prior to the competition. You are responsible for following the rules whether or not you have read them.

                <li><strong>Being prepared to compete</strong><br>You should be in the ballroom at least 15 minutes before your competition. During the competitions, we use marshalling to prepare the following heats prior dancing. Check which heat you are dancing in before the competition starts and follow the call for marshalling immediately. Remember to bring your bib number. If you miss the competition (or withdraw after the registration deadline), you will forfeit your entry fee.</li>
                <li><strong>Demonstrating good sporting conduct at all times</strong><br>You must demonstrate good sporting conduct at all times, both on and off the competition floor. This includes treating your partners, other competitors, competition officials, spectators, and the event itself with respect. Demonstrating a poor attitude by behaving in ways that our chief judge, judging panel, or other competition officials deem inappropriate or disrespectful may result in a violation penalty or disqualification.</li>
                <li><strong>Using appropriate channels to communicate your concerns</strong><br>If you have questions or concerns about our competitions, you should use appropriate channels to share your concerns, such as at the contestant meeting or in private discussion with our chief judge. You are not allowed to confront, pressure, challenge, or argue with individual judges. If you harass or verbally abuse a judge or other competition official, we may disqualify you and may also ban you from competing at our events in the future.</li>
