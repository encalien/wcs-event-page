      //   "West Coast Swing or WCS is a modern partner dance. It evolved from lindy hop in the 1960s on the west coast of America.",
      //   "It is characterized by the elastic movement of the partners, which results from a specific technique of leading and following. The dance places a strong emphasis on the musical expression of both partners and is one of the few dances that encourages free dance improvisation.",
      //   "Since it is a relatively new dance, it continues to evolve year after year and stylistically adapts to the music to which it is danced. This is usually pop, hip hop, acoustic music and blues."

            "She embarked on her WCS journey in 2014 and from the first moment she fell in love. She now competes in the Champion division and teaches in Israel, where she directs a line of West Coast Swing classes. She actively travels and teaches all around Europe.",
            "Ludovic Pelegrin started dancing at 10, when he learned rock'n'roll. His innovative and diversified dance background encompasses styles like Lindy-Hop, Balboa, Charleston, Acrobatic rock'n'roll, Salsa, Boogie Woogie, and Tap dancing. He's been a Rock and Roll, Lindy Hop, and Charleston instructor since 2009.",
            "His fondness for Swing led him to WCS in 2010. With growing enthusiasm, he attended overseas workshops, learning from all the best instructors. He also participates in many competitions, where he regularly places in the Top 3.",
            "Driven by the desire to share his passion and help others discover WCS, he started teaching WCS in 2011. After contributing to spread WCS within France, he now conducts workshops all across Europe. His diverse dance skills have earned him a reputation for amazing musical knowledge, structured and concise teaching, and great generosity."

She's competed extensively, securing both regional and national prizes, and joined a conservatory during her high school years.",
            "She ventured into rock dance at age 7, swiftly moving on to salsa and, later, West Coast Swing. Very young, she was given the opportunity to teach, where she found joy in connecting and sharing with students. After high school, she chose to specialize in WCS and relocated to Switzerland, where she now lives and works at Jang Widler's dance school.",
            "João started dancing at the age of 8 in a German folk dance group in southern Brazil. By 2006, he had expanded into various other styles such as zouk, salsa, Forro, Samba de Gafiera, and Argentine Tango. Dance became a significant part of his life, and he dedicated numerous hours weekly to professional training.",
            "In 2011, João started teaching and was introduced to West Coast Swing in 2012. He quickly fell in love with this dance. He pursued training opportunities, attending events both in Brazil and abroad. In 2014, he started teaching WCS in Brazil. He continues to teach it with passion today both in Switzerland and at various European events."

After a successful fifteen-year stint, in the possession of numerous championship titles, they chose to take a step back from their active careers following the birth of their first child.",
            "They were never able to part from dancing completely, always yearning to be back on the dancefloor.In 2013, they encountered West Coast Swing and soon became addicted to the genre. Recognising the distinct differences between ballroom and West Coast Swing, this dance became their passion, mostly because of its endless possibilities and freedom. They were unable to let competing go either, so after some years of competing, they both made it to the prestigious All - Star category.",
            "Today, Attila and Andrea spread their profound love for West Coast Swing by offering classes both in Hungary and abroad. Whether it's group sessions or private lessons, their mission is to share their extensive knowledge and deep-rooted passion. For them, dance is a part of their everyday life."
