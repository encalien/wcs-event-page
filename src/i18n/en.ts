      description: [
        "West Coast Swing or WCS is a modern partner dance. It evolved from lindy hop in the 1960s on the west coast of America.",
        "It is characterized by the elastic movement of the partners, which results from a specific technique of leading and following. The dance places a strong emphasis on the musical expression of both partners and is one of the few dances that encourages free dance improvisation.",
        "Since it is a relatively new dance, it continues to evolve year after year and stylistically adapts to the music to which it is danced. This is usually pop, hip hop, acoustic music and blues.",

Always eager to learn and explore new concepts and possibilities, he intensively practiced a variety of couple and solo dances, including ballroom, line dance and contemporary.",

While following his passion for this dance, he traveled the whole continent and reached the WSDC Advanced division. He is a very well-known face on the social floor not only for his dance skills, but also for napping in unconventional places.",

In 2019, she found West Coast Swing and was immediately captivated by its creativity and freedom. After only four months, she focused entirely on WCS, attending events and immersing herself in the community. Despite a pause due to COVID, she reignited her journey in Vienna in 2022, taking weekly classes and private lessons to advance her skills.",
            "Since then, she has competed in 12 countries across three continents, connecting with communities worldwide. International events are where she continues to grow as a dancer, learning from renowned teachers and embracing the joy of social dancing. Her musical background—playing violin since childhood and majoring in music in high school—enhances her connection to musicality and detail in WCS. As a teacher, her goal is to share the fun and creativity of West Coast Swing, passing on her passion and love for the intricacies of the dance.",
